Build product bundle promotions with tiered quantity discounts, a modern admin app, analytics, and a customer-facing bundle builder widget.

== Description ==

BundleCraft lets you group products into attractive bundle promotions. Shoppers pick products (or set quantities), watch their savings grow as they reach discount tiers, and add the whole bundle to the cart in one click. Discounts are applied with real WooCommerce coupons, so totals are correct in every cart, sidecart, and checkout view.

**Highlights**

* Tiered quantity discounts: "Buy 2+ get 10% off, 3+ get 15% off…" with a live progress bar for shoppers.
* Quantity mode with per-product steppers or a simple select-all checkbox mode.
* Full control over texts, button label, and five theme colors — with a live preview in the editor.
* Product search with drag-and-drop ordering for bundle contents.
* Variable products supported: shoppers choose variations inside the widget.
* Cart behavior per bundle: open the cart/sidecart or redirect to the cart page.
* Shortcode `[bundlecraft_bundle id="123"]` works in posts, pages, and page builders.
* Analytics dashboard: coupons created, bundle revenue, orders, cart share, and top bundles over time.
* Health-check diagnostics page and optional WooCommerce debug logging.
* Built with Vue 3 and the WordPress REST API; all pricing math runs server-side.

**Discounts that stay correct**

Bundle discounts are implemented as dynamically created WooCommerce coupons, restricted to the bundle's products and recalculated server-side from live product prices. They show up naturally in cart totals, emails, and orders — and expire automatically if unused.

**Privacy**

BundleCraft does not send data to any third-party service. All processing happens on your own site.

== Installation ==

1. Install WooCommerce (required) and BundleCraft through the Plugins screen, then activate BundleCraft.
2. Go to **BundleCraft → Bundles** and create your first bundle: add products, set discount tiers, style it, and save.
3. Place the shortcode `[bundlecraft_bundle id="1"]` in any post, page, or builder section.
4. Optionally review **BundleCraft → Analytics** and **BundleCraft → Settings**.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How are the discounts calculated? =

Server-side, always. When a shopper changes their selection the widget asks the store for a fresh quote; when the bundle is added to the cart the exact same calculation runs again and a matching WooCommerce coupon is applied. The browser never decides the discount.

= Does it work with variable products? =

Yes. Variable products show a variation dropdown inside the bundle widget and the chosen variation is added to the cart.

= Can I use my own theme or a sidecart plugin? =

The widget ships with neutral styling that inherits your theme's typography. After adding to cart, BundleCraft refreshes classic cart fragments and the WooCommerce Blocks cart store, and tries to open popular sidecarts. Use the `bundlecraft_should_enqueue_frontend_assets` filter if you need custom asset loading.

= What happens to unused discount coupons? =

A daily cleanup task deletes bundle coupons that were created more than 24 hours ago and never used. Used coupons are kept for order history and analytics.

= I used an older "Mix & Match"/"Bundle Builder" plugin from the same author. Will my bundles be kept? =

Yes. On activation, BundleCraft migrates bundles and settings from the legacy table automatically.
